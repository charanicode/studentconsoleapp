Project Description for GitHub
Student Management Console App

This is a simple Java console application that helps manage student records. The application allows you to:

Add new students with their roll number, name, and marks in multiple subjects

Calculate and display the average marks and assign grades based on performance

Search for students by their roll number

Display details of all students stored in the system

Update student details like name and marks

Delete student records by roll number

The project uses basic Java concepts like classes, ArrayLists, and HashMaps to store and manipulate student data. It is a beginner-friendly project focused on practicing object-oriented programming, collections, and user interaction via the console.
